## Meet Sphinxit!

**Sphinxit** is the **SphinxQL** query generator and the set of helpers to make
search with [Sphinx](http://sphinxsearch.com/) easy to use in any kind of Python projects like 
Django, Flask and others. Sphinxit doesn`t depends on any of these frameworks, it`s independent 
Python library and you are free to use it anywhere you need powerful Sphinx-based search. It`s not ORM
in full sense yet but provides the set of useful common methods to make full-text queries, 
filtering, ordering, grouping, counting Sphinx search results and so on.
