Meet Sphinxit!
==============

.. warning:: 
	Sphinxit documentation is not full yet. I promise to make it more detailed soon.

Hello and welcome to the **Sphinxit** documentation. This documentation is divided into
different parts. I recommend that you get started with
:ref:`installation` and then head over to the :ref:`quickstart`.

Sphinxit is the **SphinxQL** query generator and the set of helpers to make
search with `Sphinx <http://sphinxsearch.com/>`_ easy to use in any kind of Python projects like 
Django, Flask and others. Sphinxit doesn`t depends on any of these frameworks, it`s independent 
Python library and you are free to use it anywhere you need powerful Sphinx-based search. It`s not ORM
in full sense yet but provides the set of useful common methods to make full-text queries, 
filtering, ordering, grouping, counting Sphinx search results and so on.

Sphinxit documentation doesn`t cover whole Sphinx possibilities and if you are not familiar with 
SphinxSearch engine or you need some kind of Sphinx-specific documentation, visit it`s 
`official website <http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/current.html>`_.
